# Black Arts & Activism

## About this project
For my final project, I created a visually engaging and academically informative website exploring Black Art and its role in activism. This project examines the historical and cultural significance of Black artistic expression, focusing on how art has fueled social movements and revolutionary change within the Black community. The site also highlights influential Black artists and explores the meaning behind their work.

## Main Inspiration
A key text incorporated into this project is Assata by Assata Shakur. Through this work, the website explores how Black artistic expression has historically served as a tool for resistance, empowerment, and social change. Special attention is given to Shakurâ€™s poetry, her experiences as an arts and crafts teacher, and her influence on the Black Arts Movement.
