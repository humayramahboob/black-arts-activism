    <p><em>“ You can’t sit around and wait for somebody to say who you are. You need to write it and paint it and do it.” - Faith Ringgold</em></p>

      Black Art has long been a powerful tool for resistance, empowerment, and storytelling in the face of injustice. 
      This website explores how artistic expression has been deeply woven into the fight for Black liberation—from 
      the Harlem Renaissance to the Black Lives Matter movement. Through poetry, paintings, music, and more, 
      Black artists have spoken truth to power and helped shape cultural revolutions. Inspired by the writings of 
      Assata Shakur, this project also highlights how her poetry and activism reflect the enduring power of Black 
      artistic expression—and how her legacy continues to influence artists today.
