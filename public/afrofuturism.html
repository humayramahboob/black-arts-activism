        <p>Nearly three decades have passed since cultural critic <strong>Mark Dery</strong> coined the term <em>Afrofuturism</em>, asking:</p>
        <blockquote>
          “Can a community whose past has been deliberately rubbed out, and whose energies have subsequently been consumed by the search for legible traces of its history, imagine possible futures?” - Rao
        </blockquote>
    
        <p>That question continues to inspire Black creatives across the globe. Afrofuturism is more than a genre—it's a powerful cultural framework for exploring identity, liberation, and imagination. At its heart, Afrofuturism bridges African traditions with futuristic possibilities, creating new worlds where Black life thrives, leads, and transforms.</p>
    
        <p>From the techno-mythologies of <strong>Sun Ra</strong> to the visionary fiction of <strong>Octavia Butler</strong>, and the intricate paintings of <strong>Lina Iris Viktor</strong>, Afrofuturism blends science, art, spirituality, and politics into a speculative narrative of Black futures. It is, as one scholar put it:</p>
        <blockquote>
          “A way to bridge the cultural aspects of the ancient African traditions with the potential of the future.” - Rao
        </blockquote>

        <p>Afrofuturism’s influence spans fashion, music, visual art, and literature—but one of its most iconic cultural moments arrived in 2018, when director <strong>Ryan Coogler</strong> brought the world of Wakanda to life in Marvel’s <em>Black Panther</em>. With a mostly Black cast, futuristic African cityscapes, and deeply rooted cultural symbolism, the film became a landmark in Afrofuturist storytelling.</p>

        <blockquote>
          “Afrofuturism’s seismic influences can be seen in fashion, music, the visual arts, technology, science fiction and perhaps most recognizably in Ryan Coogler’s 2018 blockbuster <em>Black Panther</em>, starring Chadwick Boseman as T’Challa in the first Marvel film to host a mostly Black cast.” - Rao
        </blockquote>
    
        <p>Afrofuturism allows Black communities to challenge historical erasure and imagine new realities where Black culture, technology, and liberation are at the center of the future. It’s not just about escaping the past—it’s about reprogramming the future through bold vision, cultural pride, and radical creativity.</p>
