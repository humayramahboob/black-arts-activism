        <p>Diaspora Art reflects the journeys, identities, and layered realities of people living away from their ancestral homelands. Artists working within the diaspora often create works that explore the meaning of home, memory, and cultural heritage—connecting the past with present struggles and futures.</p>
      
        <p>As art historian Emily Shotwell notes, “Diaspora Art encompasses the diverse expressions of artists who navigate the complexities of belonging, identity, and cultural memory across multiple geographies and narratives.” These works often emerge from experiences of migration, exile, or displacement, and they highlight the resilience of communities in transition.</p>
      
        <p>Many diaspora artists focus on deeply personal and political themes. Shotwell explains that the art “is characterized by its engagement with the artists' cultural heritage and personal experiences of living between cultures, often addressing issues of race, gender, and postcolonial identity.”</p>
      
        <p>This cross-cultural perspective makes diaspora art especially powerful—it invites viewers into conversations about hybridity, adaptation, and the richness of global Black identity. From photography and sculpture to textile and digital media, diaspora artists are rewriting visual histories on their own terms.</p>
