    <h1>Jacob Lawrence</h1>
    <p>
      Jacob Lawrence (1917–2000) was a celebrated African American painter known for his bold, colorful, and narrative style that depicted the experiences of Black Americans, particularly their struggles, resilience, and contributions to American history. Born in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and raised in Harlem, New York, Lawrence grew up during the Harlem Renaissance, which significantly influenced his artistic development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence is best known for his groundbreaking series, <em>The Migration Series</em> (1940–1941), a collection of 60 panels that visually narrated the Great Migration of African Americans from the rural South to the urban North. This series, characterized by its vivid colors, simplified forms, and dynamic compositions, established Lawrence as a master storyteller in visual art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond <em>The Migration Series</em>, Lawrence created numerous other works exploring themes of social justice, labor, and community, including series on the lives of historical figures such as Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, and John Brown. His ability to transform complex historical narratives into accessible, visually striking imagery made him one of the most influential artists of the 20th century.
