  <h1>Jean-Michel Basquiat</h1>
<p>
  Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960–1988) was a groundbreaking African American artist known for his vibrant, expressive paintings that combined text, symbols, and abstract imagery to explore themes of identity, race, power, and history. Born in Brooklyn, New York, to a Haitian father and Puerto Rican mother, Basquiat’s multicultural background greatly influenced his artistic style and subject matter.
</p>
<p>
  Basquiat began his career as a street artist under the pseudonym "SAMO," creating graffiti with cryptic messages throughout New York City. His work quickly gained attention for its raw energy and social commentary, leading him to transition from street art to the fine art world. By the early 1980s, Basquiat became a central figure in the New York art scene, collaborating with artists like Andy Warhol.
</p>
<p>
  Some of Basquiat’s most iconic works include <em>Untitled (1981)</em>, <em>Hollywood Africans</em> (1983), and <em>Skull</em> (1981). His distinctive style featured bold colors, dynamic lines, and recurring motifs such as crowns, skeletal figures, and text fragments, which reflected his interest in African American culture, history, and the struggles of marginalized communities.
</p>
<p>
  Despite his meteoric rise to fame, Basquiat’s life was marked by personal struggles, including addiction, which ultimately led to his untimely death at the age of 27. However, his artistic legacy has only grown over time, with his works becoming highly sought after and widely exhibited in major museums worldwide. Today, Jean-Michel Basquiat is celebrated as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, whose work continues to inspire conversations about race, identity, and artistic expression.
